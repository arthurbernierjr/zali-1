### **Lesson: JavaScript Basics**

**1. Variables and Data Types:**

- In JavaScript, variables store data. You can declare them using `var`, `let`, or `const`:

  - `let` and `const` have block scope, while `var` has function scope.

  Example:

  ```javascript
  let x = 10;
  const y = 20;
  var z = 30;
  ```

- JavaScript supports several data types:
  - **String**: `"Hello World"`
  - **Number**: `42`
  - **Boolean**: `true` or `false`
  - **Array**: `[1, 2, 3]`
  - **Object**: `{ key: 'value' }`

**2. Control Flow (Conditional Statements):**

- Use `if`, `else if`, and `else` to control the flow of your program.

  Example:

  ```javascript
  if (x > 5) {
    console.log("X is greater than 5");
  } else {
    console.log("X is less than or equal to 5");
  }
  ```

**3. Loops:**

- Loops repeat actions. Common loops include `for`, `while`, and `do...while`.

  Example (For loop):

  ```javascript
  for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    console.log(i);
  }
  ```

**4. Functions:**

- Functions allow you to reuse code. They can accept inputs (parameters) and return outputs.

  Example:

  ```javascript
  function add(a, b) {
    return a + b;
  }

  let result = add(2, 3); // 5
  ```

### **Lesson: Python Basics**

**1. Variables and Data Types:**

- In Python, variables are dynamically typed, meaning you don't need to specify the type.

  Example:

  ```python
  my_var = 10
  name = "Zali"
  ```

- Basic Python data types:
  - **String**: `"Hello"`
  - **Integer**: `42`
  - **Float**: `3.14`
  - **Boolean**: `True` or `False`
  - **List**: `[1, 2, 3]`
  - **Dictionary**: `{"key": "value"}`

**2. Control Flow (Conditional Statements):**

- Use `if`, `elif`, and `else` to control the logic in Python.

  Example:

  ```python
  if x > 5:
      print("X is greater than 5")
  else:
      print("X is 5 or less")
  ```

**3. Loops:**

- Python offers `for` and `while` loops to iterate over data.

  Example:

  ```python
  for i in range(5):
      print(i)
  ```

**4. Functions:**

- Define functions in Python using `def`. They can return values.

  Example:

  ```python
  def add(a, b):
      return a + b

  result = add(2, 3) # 5
  ```

### **Demonstration Projects**

**1. JavaScript: Simple Calculator**

- Build a basic calculator that can add, subtract, multiply, and divide two numbers.

  Example:

  ```javascript
  function add(a, b) {
    return a + b;
  }

  function subtract(a, b) {
    return a - b;
  }

  function divide(a, b) {
    return a / b;
  }

  function multiply(a, b) {
    return a * b;
  }

  console.log(add(5, 3)); // 8
  console.log(subtract(5, 3)); // 2
  console.log(divide(10, 2)); //5
  console.log(multiply(10, 2)); //20
  ```

**2. Python: Data Processing Script**

- Create a Python script that processes a list of numbers, calculating the sum and average.

  Example:

  ```python
  numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

  total = sum(numbers)
  avg = total / len(numbers)

  print(f"Total: {total}, Average: {avg}")
  ```

---

### **Imitate: Coding Examples to Follow**

1. **JavaScript Example**: Create a loop that counts from 1 to 10 and prints each number to the console.

   ```javascript
   for (let i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
     console.log(i);
   }
   ```

2. **Python Example**: Write a function that checks if a number is even or odd and returns the result.

   ```python
   def check_even_odd(number):
       if number % 2 == 0:
           return "Even"
       else:
           return "Odd"

   print(check_even_odd(5))  # Odd
   ```

### **Practice: Coding Challenges**

1. **JavaScript Challenge**: Build a simple counter app with buttons to increment and decrement the value.
2. **Python Challenge**: Create a Python script that takes user input and checks whether the input string is a palindrome.

---

### **Homework Activities**

#### **JavaScript Homework:**

**Task 1: Counter App**

- Build a counter application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Steps:

  1. Use HTML to create two buttons (Increment and Decrement) and a display area for the counter value.
  2. Style the buttons and text using CSS.
  3. Use JavaScript to update the counter value when the buttons are clicked.

  Example structure:

  ```html
  <h1>Simple Counter</h1>
  <p id="counter">0</p>
  <button onclick="increment()">Increment</button>
  <button onclick="decrement()">Decrement</button>

  <script>
    let counter = 0;

    function increment() {
      counter++;
      document.getElementById("counter").innerText = counter;
    }

    function decrement() {
      counter--;
      document.getElementById("counter").innerText = counter;
    }
  </script>
  ```

**Task 2: Theoretical Homework Questions**

1. What are the three main types of loops in JavaScript, and what are their differences?

   - `For` Loop : use when you know how many times you need to iterate
   - `While` Loop : use when the number of iterations is not known beforehand
   - `Do... While` Loop : use when you want the loop to run at least once beforehand.

2. Explain the differences between `var`, `let`, and `const` in JavaScript.

   -`var`: function-scoped, meaning if declared inside a function, it only is accessible within that function & you can redeclare a variable

   -`let`: blocked-scoped, meaning it only accessible within the block it is declared & the variable can be reassign

   `const`: blocked-scoped & cannot be reassigned

3. What is a JavaScript closure, and why is it important?
   - A javascript closure is the inner function ability to access the outer function scope.
   - This is important to keep information private, create special functions that show certain thing, keep tracking of information

#### **Python Homework:**

**Task 1: List Processing Script**

- Write a Python script that accepts a list of numbers and outputs:

  - The sum of the numbers.
  - The average of the numbers.
  - The largest and smallest numbers.

  Example:

  ```python
  numbers = [3, 7, 2, 8, 10]

  total = sum(numbers)
  average = total / len(numbers)
  largest = max(numbers)
  smallest = min(numbers)

  print(f"Total: {total}, Average: {average}, Largest: {largest}, Smallest: {smallest}")
  ```

**Task 2: Python Coding Challenge**

- Write a function that takes a string and returns the most common character in the string. If thereâ€™s a tie, return the first one encountered.

  Example:

  ```python
  def most_common_char(string):
      frequency = {}
      for char in string:
          frequency[char] = frequency.get(char, 0) + 1
      return max(frequency, key=frequency.get)

  print(most_common_char("hello"))  # l
  ```
